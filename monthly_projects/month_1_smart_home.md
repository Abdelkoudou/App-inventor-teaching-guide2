### Technical Requirements

#### ESP32 Setup (PictoBlox Blocks)
```
When ESP32 Starts Up:
  Initialize Bluetooth as "SmartHome"
  Set Digital Pin 2 as OUTPUT

Forever:
  If Bluetooth Message Received:
    If message = "ON":
      Set Digital Pin 2 to HIGH
      Send "Device turned ON" via Bluetooth
    If message = "OFF":
      Set Digital Pin 2 to LOW
      Send "Device turned OFF" via Bluetooth
    If message = "STATUS":
      If Digital Pin 2 is HIGH:
        Send "Device is ON" via Bluetooth
      Else:
        Send "Device is OFF" via Bluetooth
```

#### App Inventor Components
- **Buttons** for different controls
- **Labels** for status display
- **BluetoothClient** for Bluetooth communication
- **Images** for visual appeal
